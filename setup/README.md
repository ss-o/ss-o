Setup
=====

- Package lists used by the `make` build at the top level
  - OS packages - Mac OS X / macOS and Linux distributions (RHEL/CentOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Alpine)
  - language libraries for Python, Perl, Golang
- Simple standalone installation scripts `install_*.sh` for common technologies that make it easy to set up a new laptop / workstation every time you work for a new company

Almost nothing should need to be done manually, a couple commands and you should be up and running.

###### Mac XCode for Developers

Run `git` - it will automatically prompt to install XCode if needed. If git runs, XCode is likely already installed.
